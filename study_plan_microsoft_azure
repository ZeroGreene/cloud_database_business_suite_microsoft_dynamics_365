===================================================

Great 👍 — Developer path it is.
Here’s a focused Microsoft Azure study plan specifically for developers, aimed at building real-world skills and clearing AZ-204 (Azure Developer Associate).

Azure Developer Study Plan (AZ-204 Focused)
Timeline: 8–10 weeks

Daily time: ~1.5–2 hours
Outcome: Build, deploy, secure, and monitor cloud-native apps on Azure

Phase 1: Azure Fundamentals for Developers (Week 1)

(Fast-track, not AZ-900 heavy)

Learn

Azure App Service vs VM vs Functions

Azure Resource Groups & ARM basics

Azure CLI

Azure Portal navigation

Azure Active Directory (app registrations)

Hands-on

Deploy a simple Web App (Node/.NET/Java/Python)

Use Azure CLI to create resources

Configure App Settings & environment variables

Phase 2: Azure Compute & APIs (Weeks 2–3)
Learn

App Service

Deployment slots

Scaling

Azure Functions

HTTP triggers

Timer triggers

API Management

APIs, policies, rate limiting

Hands-on

Build a REST API

Deploy it using App Service

Add Azure Functions for background jobs

Front with API Management

Phase 3: Azure Data & Storage (Weeks 4–5)
Learn

Azure SQL Database

Cosmos DB (Core SQL API)

Blob Storage

Queue Storage

Hands-on

Store files in Blob Storage

Use Cosmos DB for app data

Implement Queue-based async processing

Phase 4: Security & Identity (Week 6)
Learn

Azure AD authentication

Managed Identities

Key Vault

RBAC

Hands-on

Secure your app with Azure AD

Access secrets using Managed Identity

Store secrets in Key Vault

Phase 5: DevOps & CI/CD (Weeks 7–8)
Learn

GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps

Build & release pipelines

Infrastructure as Code (Bicep / ARM)

Hands-on

CI/CD pipeline → auto deploy on push

Blue-green deployment using slots

Provision infra using Bicep

Phase 6: Monitoring & Optimization (Week 9)
Learn

Application Insights

Azure Monitor

Log Analytics

Cost optimization

Hands-on

Add telemetry & logging

Create alerts for failures

Analyze performance bottlenecks

Phase 7: Exam Prep & Real Project (Week 10)
Build a Capstone Project

Example:

Cloud-native backend for a SaaS app

App Service (API)

Azure Functions (background jobs)

Cosmos DB

Blob Storage

Azure AD auth

CI/CD pipeline

Monitoring & alerts

Tech Stack Recommendation (Pick One)

.NET + Azure SDK (best Microsoft integration)

Node.js + TypeScript

Python + FastAPI

Best Learning Resources (Developer-Focused)

Microsoft Learn → AZ-204 learning path

Azure SDK documentation

GitHub sample repos

Practice exams (Tutorials Dojo / MeasureUp)

Weekly Output Checklist

By the end, you should be able to:
